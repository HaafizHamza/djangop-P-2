### Urls Mapping:
                 ** How the urls routing settings. In an App, the urls arrage in
                 an order and then include the app urls in our project urls. 
                 When a user requests a particular page the, request goes to 
                 project urls and in case dynamic request wsgi activate and see
                 in the miidleware of our project's settings.py file and checks
                 the context processor and return the requested urls to user. **
### View Decorator:
                   If we are using design patterns then the chances are high that 
                   we must use the decorators. Decorator is where you modify the 
                   behavior of an object by enclosing it in another object named
                   decorator. Decorator Dynamically alter the functionality of a 
                   function or a method or a class without making subclasses or 
                   change the source code of the decorator itself. In this approa-
                   -ch your cade will be more clean, readable, reuseable and reduce
                   the boilerplate code. This allows us to add functionality to 
                   multiple classes using a single method.
